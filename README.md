## Inspiration
Urbani is inspired by the resilience and renewal of urban areas impacted by conflicts and natural disasters. Recognizing the urgent need for sustainable infracstructures, green spaces and cultural presevation, our platform draws inspiration from initiatives like the UNDP's efforts in Ukrainian cities to tap into local intelligence for reconstruction.

The transformative impact of Bilbao's urban regeneration, catalyzed by the iconic Guggenheim Museum, further showcases the potential of cultural and architectural innovation to revitalize cities, proving that thoughtful regeneration can promote economic growth, reduce environmental impact, and heal communities. The success of Bilbao's revitalization journey, often referred to as the Guggenheim effect, underscores the profound influence of innovative architecture and cultural landmarks in revitalizing neglected urban areas.

## What it does
Our platform leverages smart solutions and technologies to revilitze urban spaces disturbed by past human and natural conflict. Urbani connects businesses with leading urban planners to collaborate on projects featured on our platform, forging a focus on sustainable practices and community resillience. Through AI consultancy, we ensure that businesses can find the best-suited urban planners for their specific projects, considering factors like geographical challenges, disaster recovery, and sustainability requirements. Our platform also features advanced 3D mapping visualization, allowing both businesses and local communities to engage and visualize future projects in their area. This dual approach not only facilitates informed decision-making but also encourages community involvement and feedback, fostering a more inclusive urban development process.

## How we built it
The platform features an AI consultancy service built using LLM that leverages lang-chain framework. The LLM analyzes the architects featured on our platform based on the custom dataset with their company details. Then, the Langchain framework trains the LLM such that it summarizes the best-suited architects based on business needs. The 3D visualization model is built with Sketchup and Google Earth. Using the latitude and longitude of a historical catastrophic zone, we were able to add architect designs and models onto the Google Earth Platform. The model can be viewed in 3D as well as in street view. The UI is built using Chakra UI and React and includes hover effects for optimized visualization.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we ran into is deciding on our business model. We had different options that we consider which aligns with our value proposition and how we become profitable. Another challenge was deciding which features to include in our MVP. We had a lot of ideas which had to be narrowed down in order to create the best MVP.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our proudest accomplishment was integrating 3D visualizations for architects to display their designs in an interactive way that visualizes in urban areas. We were also able to connect the AI with the architect platforms so that it can use their data to find the best architects for person business needs.. We are also proud of deciding on a viable business model that aligns with our platform.

## What we learned
We learned about the importance of an MVP in refining our business model. We learned about feature prioritization and the importance of market research in creating products. We also learned about the possibility of different revenue streams and user acquisition strategies.

## What's next for Urbani
Our focus remains on advancing urban regeneration and strengthening community collaboration. Our plan is to scale by exploring new markets and regions, which serves as a cross-cultural exchange. We see virtual reality as a big potential in our platform. We will also expand stakeholder reach such as governments, academic institutions, and healthcare organizations who are interested in engaging with Urban regeneration. We will also integrate data analytics and personalized UI interfaces in the future.
