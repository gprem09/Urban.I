Country: United Kingdom
Profile: Studio Egret West was established in November 2004 by Christophe Egret and David West with a shared vision: To offer strategy with architectural specificity; and specificity within an overall strategy.

Planning is too often seen as soulless, unspecific proposals that gather dust on shelves. We believe that the way forward is the osmosis between planning and architecture. Studio Egret West is just this.
