They may appear relatively normal to look at – forget the clichés of black polo neck shirts and square-rimmed glasses – but the brains behind their ordinary exteriors are a different matter altogether. Since they set up in 1997 they’ve built a reputation for designing buildings with a strong and unique identity, from private housing developments to complex regeneration projects. Their innovation and creativity have been applauded all over the world, earning them numerous awards not just for looking pretty but making a positive impact on the world.
